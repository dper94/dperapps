      <p class="intro">
        Quiet Mode ("we", "the App") respects your privacy and is committed to
        protecting your data. This policy explains what information we collect
        and how we use it.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>No registration or login:</strong> We do not request personal
          information from users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics data:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics to improve
          the app experience. This includes:
          <ul>
            <li>App interactions (features used, events within the app).</li>
            <li>Approximate location (city/region level, not precise GPS).</li>
            <li>
              Device information (model, operating system version, language
              settings).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Important:</strong> This data is used solely for internal
              analysis to improve the app. We do not share this information with
              third parties.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Subscriptions:</strong> To enable premium features, we use
          Google Play / App Store, which process payments and handle
          subscription information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accessibility and notification services:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We use the accessibility service to detect which apps are active
              and enable focus sessions.
            </li>
            <li>
              We use the notification service to identify distracting
              notifications and block them when appropriate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Important:</strong> This information is not stored or
              shared with third parties; it is only used for the app's
              functionality within the device.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Use of information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The information collected is used solely to enable Quiet Mode's
          functionality, such as blocking apps and notifications and managing
          focus sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Analytics data collected through Firebase is used exclusively for
          internal purposes to understand how users interact with the app and
          improve its features and performance.
        </li>
        <li>We do not share any data with third parties.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Security</h2>

          which apply industry-standard security measures.

          Analytics data collected through Firebase Analytics is transmitted
          securely and stored in accordance with Google's privacy and security
          standards.

        <li>
          Information obtained through accessibility and notification services
          remains on the device.
